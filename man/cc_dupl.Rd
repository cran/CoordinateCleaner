\title{
Flag Duplicated Records
}
\description{
Flags duplicated records based on species name and coordinates, as well as user-defined additional columns. True (specimen) duplicates or duplicates from the same species can make up the bulk of records in a biological collection database, but are undesirable for many analyses. Both can be flagged with this function, the former given enough additional information.
}
\usage{
cc_dupl(x, lon = "decimallongitude", lat = "decimallatitude", 
        species = "species", additions = NULL, value = "clean", verbose = T)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a data.frame. Containing geographical coordinates and species names.
}
  \item{lon}{
a character string. The column with the longitude coordinates. Default = \dQuote{decimallongitude}.
}
  \item{lat}{
a character string. The column with the longitude coordinates. Default = \dQuote{decimallatitude}.
}
  \item{species}{
a character string. The column with the species name. Default = \dQuote{species}.
}
  \item{additions}{
a vector of character strings. Additional columns to be included in the test for duplication. For example as below, collector name and collector number.
}
  \item{value}{
a character string.  Defining the output value. See value.
}
  \item{verbose}{
logical. If TRUE reports the name of the test and the number of records flagged
}
}
\value{
Depending on the \sQuote{value} argument, either a \code{data.frame} containing the records considered correct by the test (\dQuote{clean}) or a logical vector, with TRUE = test passed and FALSE = test failed/potentially problematic (\dQuote{flags}). Default = \dQuote{clean}.
